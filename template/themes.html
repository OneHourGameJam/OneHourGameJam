		Here you can vote on the themes you would like to appear in 1HGJ jams.

	<p>
		Themes suggested above will appear in this list. Once a theme receives enough votes, it becomes considered for a jam, depending on its popularity. Themes which don't perform as well as others regularly get removed, the threshold for removal however depends on the popularity of the other suggested themes. Old themes are also removed to make way for new ones, irrespective of their popularity as the votes for them likely no longer represent the opinion of currently active participants. Any theme that gets removed due to unpopularity or age can be suggested again at any point.

		<b>Admin instructions</b>
		<p>
			<b>GENERAL:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Below is an ordered list of themes, ordered by popularity. Non-admin users only see the following columns: VOTE and THEME. Their lists are also not ordered in any particular way.</li>
				<li>Themes must get a minimum number of votes before their popularity is shown. Old themes are also marked as old, as their votes likely no longer reflect the opinions of current participants. If a theme is deleted, it can be suggested again and starts from 0 votes. If it's banned then it can't be suggested until unbanned or deleted. </li>
				<li>After each jam, the themes in this list should be pruned. I suggest the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Delete the theme used in the jam.</li>
						<li>Delete themes marked as OLD.</li>
						<li>Delete themes, which remain marked as UNPOPULAR.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Themes which become marked as OLD between two jams can still be used in the next jam, if you think they're popular enough.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>LEGEND:</b> Themes are marked in various ways, depending on their current status:
			<ul>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/star.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>TOP</b> - Theme is one of the top voted themes. The number of themes marked as "Top" can be set on the <a href='?page=config'>Configuration page</a> (default is top 5). These themes appear as suggestions on the <a href='?page=newjam'>Schedule Jam page</a>.</li>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/tick.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>KEEP</b> - Theme is not one of the top themes, but is popular enough to be kept in voting for the next jam. The number of themes to keep between jams can be set on the <a href='?page=config'>Configuration page</a> (default is top 20)</li>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/ban.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>BANNED</b> - Theme is not visible to users and cannot be suggested again. To ban/unban a theme, click the Action dropdown.</li>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/votes.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>TOO FEW VOTES</b> - Theme has not yet received enough votes to get a popularity rating. These themes should be kept between jams. The minimum number of votes for a theme's popularity to appear can be set on the <a href='?page=config'>Configuration page</a> (default is top 10).</li>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/clock.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>OLD</b> - Theme was suggested a long time ago and its popularity likely no longer reflects the opinion of current participants. Should be deleted after the next jam. The threshold for a theme to be marked as old can be set on the <a href='?page=config'>Configuration page</a> (default is 90 days).</li>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/unpopular.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>UNPOPULAR</b> - Theme is not within the top rated themes and should be deleted after the next jam.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ICON COLOURS:</b> The theme status icons are coloured in a way, which reflects what to do about them:
			<ul>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/green.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>KEEP AND CAN BE SELECTED</b> (TOP and KEEP) - Theme should be kept between jams and can be selected as the theme for a jam (due to sufficient votes, popularity,... )</li>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/yellow.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>KEEP BUT DO NOT SELECT</b> (BANNED and TOO FEW VOTES) - Theme should be kept between jams, but not selected (due to insufficient votes, being banned,... )</li>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/red.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>DELETE AFTER JAM</b> (OLD and UNPOPULAR) - Theme should be deleted after the next jam (due to unpopularity, age,... )</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>POPULARITY AND APATHY:</b> To help you choose the themes, two values are calculated: Popularity and Apathy. In the formulas below, the word UPVOTE, DOWNVOTE, NEUTRALVOTE represent the number of +1 votes, -1 votes and 0 votes respectivelly.
			<ul>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/star.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>POPULARITY</b> Meant to represnet how popular a theme is among the people who have an opinion about it. Note that voting 0 has no effect on popularity. The higher the number, the better. The formula is UPVOTE / (UPVOTE + DOWNVOTE)</li>
				<li><img src='{{{template_path}}}images/apathy.png' style='width: 16px;'> <b>APATHY</b> Meant to represent how opinionated people are about this theme. A theme with one +1 vote and lots of 0 votes is likely a worse choice than one with 9 +1 votes and 3 -1 votes, after all. The lower the number, the better. While popularity will likely govern most decisions on which theme to select, apathy can be a good way to decide between two themes with similar popularity scores. The formula is NEUTRALVOTE / (UPVOTE + DOWNVOTE)</li>
			</ul>
