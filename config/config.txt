Joining our IRC channel (<a href='irc:afternet.org/1hgj'>#1hgj</a> on <a href='http://afternet.org' target='_BLANK'>afternet.org</a>) is however a good idea, as the theme is first announced there!</p><h4>Is there a theme?</h4><p>Yes! At the start of the hour, the theme is announced in the IRC channel (<a href='irc:afternet.org/1hgj'>#1hgj</a> on <a href='http://afternet.org' target='_BLANK'>afternet.org</a>).</p><h4>How long do I have to finish?</h4><p>:D</p><h4>Can I use premade assets?</h4><p>You are free to use premade assets but it is recommended that you make at least one game from scratch.</p><h4>What happens after the jam?</h4><p>At about 21:30 UTC the Bitslap brothers stream themselves playing each of the games on <a href='http://www.twitch.tv/bitslap'>twitch.tv/bitslap</a>. The stream usually lasts about 2 hours.</p><h4>What if I don't finish in time?</h4><p>If you finish and submit your game before the stream ends, we'll play it on stream, even if it takes you more than an hour to finish.</p><h4>Can I participate after the jam has ended?</h4><p>If you come late you can still participate. If the stream is over, then your game won't be played on-stream, obviously, but we'll still keep it on the site!</p>
